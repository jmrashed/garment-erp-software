- Each module should have its own controller, model, and migration files, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
- Utilize Laravel's built-in features like **Eloquent ORM** for database interactions, **Form Requests** for validation, and **Middleware** for access control.
- For real-time features (like inventory tracking), consider using **Laravel Echo** or **WebSockets**.
- Implement **API versioning** to ensure backward compatibility as the system evolves.
- Use **Laravel's job queues** for handling long-running processes, such as generating reports or processing bulk data.

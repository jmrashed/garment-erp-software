# System Interfaces Document for Garment ERP Software

## Introduction
This document describes the system interfaces for the Garment ERP software. It identifies all internal and external interfaces that the system will use, providing a detailed understanding of how the software will interact with other systems and users.

## Interface Overview
The Garment ERP system will have multiple interfaces, categorized as follows:

1. **User Interfaces (UI)**
   - Web Application Interface
   - Mobile Application Interface

2. **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**
   - RESTful APIs for External Integrations
   - Internal APIs for Module Intercommunication

3. **External Interfaces**
   - Payment Gateway Integration
   - Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Interfaces
   - Supplier and Vendor Systems

## 1. User Interfaces

### 1.1 Web Application Interface
- **Description**: A web-based interface that allows users to access the ERP functionalities via a web browser.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (or Angular/Vue.js).
- **Key Features**:
  - Responsive design for desktop and tablet use.
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - Dashboards for different roles (Admin, Manager, Sales Rep).
  - Data visualization components (charts, graphs).

### 1.2 Mobile Application Interface
- **Description**: A mobile application interface for iOS and Android devices.
- **Technologies Used**: Flutter or React Native.
- **Key Features**:
  - User-friendly mobile UI for accessing ERP functionalities.
  - Push notifications for order updates and alerts.
  - Offline access to critical data.

## 2. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

### 2.1 RESTful APIs for External Integrations
- **Description**: APIs that enable communication between the Garment ERP system and external applications or services.
- **Key Features**:
  - CRUD operations for accessing and managing resources (products, orders, inventory).
  - Authentication using OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure access.
  - Versioning for backward compatibility.

### 2.2 Internal APIs for Module Intercommunication
- **Description**: APIs that facilitate communication between different modules of the ERP system.
- **Key Features**:
  - Microservices architecture to enable modular development.
  - Service discovery for efficient routing between modules.
  - Event-driven communication for real-time updates.

## 3. External Interfaces

### 3.1 Payment Gateway Integration
- **Description**: An interface for processing payments through external payment gateways.
- **Examples**: PayPal, Stripe, or local payment processors.
- **Key Features**:
  - Secure transaction processing.
  - Handling of payment confirmations and failures.
  - Integration with the order management module to update order status.

### 3.2 Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Interfaces
- **Description**: Interfaces for integrating with third-party logistics providers for shipping and fulfillment.
- **Key Features**:
  - Sending shipment requests and tracking updates.
  - Receiving logistics status updates (shipped, in transit, delivered).
  - Integration with inventory management for stock updates.

### 3.3 Supplier and Vendor Systems
- **Description**: Interfaces for managing relationships and transactions with suppliers and vendors.
- **Key Features**:
  - Data exchange for purchase orders, invoices, and inventory updates.
  - API or file-based interfaces for importing/exporting data.
  - Integration for managing supplier performance metrics.

## Interface Design Considerations
- **Security**: All interfaces must follow best practices for security, including data encryption and secure authentication.
- **Scalability**: The system interfaces should be designed to handle increasing loads and additional integrations in the future.
- **Documentation**: Each API should have comprehensive documentation, including endpoint definitions, request/response formats, and examples.

## Conclusion
This document outlines the critical interfaces for the Garment ERP software. Each interface is designed to ensure seamless interaction between users, internal modules, and external systems, facilitating efficient operations and improving user experience.

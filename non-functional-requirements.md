# Non-Functional Requirements Document for Garment ERP Software

## Project Overview
This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the Garment ERP software. Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system, addressing how the system performs its functions rather than the specific behaviors.

## 1. Performance Requirements

### 1.1 Response Time
- **Requirement**: The system shall have a response time of less than 2 seconds for any user-initiated actions under normal operating conditions.
- **Details**: Actions include loading dashboards, processing orders, and generating reports.

### 1.2 Scalability
- **Requirement**: The system shall be able to scale horizontally to support up to 10,000 concurrent users without degradation of performance.
- **Details**: This may involve adding additional servers or load balancers as needed.

### 1.3 Throughput
- **Requirement**: The system shall be capable of processing at least 1,000 transactions per minute.
- **Details**: Transactions include order entries, inventory updates, and billing processes.

## 2. Security Requirements

### 2.1 User Authentication
- **Requirement**: The system shall implement strong user authentication methods, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Details**: MFA should be mandatory for all administrative users.

### 2.2 Data Encryption
- **Requirement**: The system shall encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- **Details**: This includes user credentials, financial data, and customer information.

### 2.3 Role-Based Access Control
- **Requirement**: The system shall enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles.
- **Details**: Access levels should be defined for all user roles in the system.

## 3. Usability Requirements

### 3.1 User Interface
- **Requirement**: The system shall have an intuitive user interface that adheres to best practices in UI/UX design.
- **Details**: User feedback should be incorporated into design iterations to enhance usability.

### 3.2 Documentation
- **Requirement**: The system shall provide comprehensive user documentation and help resources.
- **Details**: Documentation should include user manuals, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.

### 3.3 Accessibility
- **Requirement**: The system shall comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
- **Details**: This includes features such as keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## 4. Reliability Requirements

### 4.1 Availability
- **Requirement**: The system shall have an uptime of 99.9%, excluding scheduled maintenance.
- **Details**: Any downtime should be communicated in advance to users.

### 4.2 Backup and Recovery
- **Requirement**: The system shall implement automated backup processes with a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 1 hour.
- **Details**: Regular backups should be stored offsite to ensure data safety.

### 4.3 Error Handling
- **Requirement**: The system shall provide clear and actionable error messages to users.
- **Details**: Error logs should be maintained for system administrators to review.

## 5. Maintainability Requirements

### 5.1 Code Quality
- **Requirement**: The system shall adhere to coding standards and best practices to ensure maintainability.
- **Details**: Code reviews should be conducted regularly to ensure adherence to standards.

### 5.2 System Updates
- **Requirement**: The system shall support seamless updates with minimal downtime.
- **Details**: Update procedures should be documented and tested in advance.

## 6. Compliance Requirements

### 6.1 Regulatory Compliance
- **Requirement**: The system shall comply with relevant industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Details**: Compliance audits should be conducted regularly to ensure adherence.

### 6.2 Data Privacy
- **Requirement**: The system shall implement measures to protect user privacy and manage data consent.
- **Details**: Users should be informed about data collection practices and have the option to manage their consent.

## Conclusion
This document outlines the essential non-functional requirements for the Garment ERP software. These requirements ensure that the system is not only functional but also meets the necessary quality standards for performance, security, usability, and compliance. Regular reviews and updates to these requirements will be necessary to adapt to evolving business needs and technological advancements.
